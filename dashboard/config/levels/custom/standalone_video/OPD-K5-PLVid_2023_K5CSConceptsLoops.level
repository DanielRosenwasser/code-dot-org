Think of **coding** as a special tool in this big kit—it's all about getting hands-on and **writing programs to fix specific problems**. Think of it this way: while **every coder dips into the pool of computer science, not everyone studying computer science decides to pick up coding** as their thing.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n#### In this module, we are going to breakdown **foundational concepts in coding** and practice building these skills with **block code** in Maze lab. \r\n\r\n## Watch the video below to learn more about Computer Science in everyday life. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
