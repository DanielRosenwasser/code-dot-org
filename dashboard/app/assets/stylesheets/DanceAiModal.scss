/* This file generates CSS that will be used to animate the Blockly blocks
 * in the DanceAiModal's UI.  We need it to be CSS so that the styling can
 * be applied to Blockly blocks that we are embedding.  The CSS selectors
 * are highly-specific to the current version of Blockly, and to the blocks
 * that we are embedding, and will likely need to be updated in case any of
 * these things change.
